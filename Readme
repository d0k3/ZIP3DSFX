**ZIP3DSFX**
Barebones ZIP-based SFX extractor for the 3DS console

To use, rename your ZIP archive to 'archive.zip', put it into the data directory and compile this using the Makefile. If you want to customize the SMDH file, edit AppInfo and icon.png in the resources.dir.

This is untested with large files and archives. Use at your own risk!
